These are the projects I've worked on since I began learning web development, starting with HTML and progressing to using all three languages to create meaningful projects. I have written a detailed description of each project I've worked on so far, compiled them together, and uploaded them recently to provide better clarity and understanding of each project. Please take the time to read through each project's description, as it will make it much easier to understand the code.
